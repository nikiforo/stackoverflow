At first, I don't know play, but it seems, that question is related to scala.
I tried to simplify your sample, according to your question(what is _):

    object Main {
      "ean" -> longNumber.verifying("validation.ean.duplicate", Product.findByEan(_).isEmpty)
    }

    object longNumber {
      def verifying(s: String, f: String => Boolean): String = ???
    }

    object Product{
      def findByEan(s: String): Seq[Int] = ???
    }

Look at Main

    "ean" -> longNumber.verifying("validation.ean.duplicate", Product.findByEan(_).isEmpty)

this can be rewritten to

    "ean" -> longNumber.verifying("validation.ean.duplicate", t => Product.findByEan(t).isEmpty)

longNumber.verifying takes some string and a function f: String => Boolean, does something with it and return String.
In product we just have simple function, that takes string and return Seq.
